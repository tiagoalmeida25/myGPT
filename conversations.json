However, I can guide you through the process of saving your models using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which do support saving models to local files or cloud storage services like Google Drive (which has a similar API to OneDrive).\n\nFor example, in TensorFlow, you can save a model using the `save()` function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming you've already trained and built your model named 'model'\ntf.saved_model.save(model, '/path/to/save/directory')\n```\n\nFor PyTorch, use the `torch.save()` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Assuming you've already trained and built your model named 'model'\ntorch.save(model.state_dict(), '/path/to/save/directory/model.pt')\ntorch.save(model, '/path/to/save/directory/model.pth')\n```\n\nThese examples save the models locally in a specified directory. To upload them to cloud storage services like OneDrive, you would need to use their respective APIs and additional libraries (like `google-cloud-storage` for Google Drive). Make sure that your authentication is properly set up before attempting to upload the files.\n\nFor more information on saving models with TensorFlow and PyTorch:\n\n* [TensorFlow Save/Load Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/save_and_restore)\n* [PyTorch Save/Load Model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/saving_loading_models_intro.html)"}]
